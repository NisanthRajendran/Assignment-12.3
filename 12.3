1.What is meant by FlumeNG ?
      Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data.
      At a high-level, Flume NG uses a single-hop message delivery guarantee semantics to provide end-to-end reliability for the system
      
2.Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow?
      Yes,it provides end to end reliability of the flow. 
      Flume uses a transactional approach in data flow.The channels contain transactional repositories where source and the sink are encapsulated.
      These channels are responsible for 100% reliablity to data flow.
      
3.Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations?
      Yes,it can distribute data to multiple destinations.The Event flows from one source to multiple channels and multiple destinations.
      It is achieved by defining a flow multiplexer.
      
4.Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is faster?
      *MEMORY Channel – Events are read from the source into memory and passed to the sink.
 	    *JDBC Channel – JDBC Channel stores the events in an embedded Derby database.
     	*FILE Channel –File Channel writes the contents to a file on the file system after reading the event from a source. 
       The file is deleted only after the contents are successfully delivered to the sink.
      
      MEMORY Channel is the fastest channel among the three however has the risk of data loss. 
      The channel that you choose completely depends on the nature of the big data application and the value of each event.
